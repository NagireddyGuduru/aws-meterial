what is Cloud Computing?
Be consume what you want

what is IT infrastructure?
eg: start training institue
-- servers(UNIX/CPU/RAM/HDD)
-- DataBase Servers
-- Storage (youtube need a storage. db will not give performance)
-- Load increases add more 
-- Load balancers
-- Facility i.e we need a place or area or pyshical area.
-- power supply
-- Cooling
-- Networking
-- Employees i.e storage engg. to maintain the infrastructure.
-- DNS (Domain Name service)
-- security

How to setup infrastructure?
 -- Need to buy all of above.
 -- Need to hire admin people to maintain.
 -- should focus on values of the customer
 -- put lots of upfront inverstment. i.expensive.

Cloud:
Instead of maintaing youself get from cloud.

Define Cloud Computing:
-----------------------
Consuming IT resources on demand over internet. "pay as you go".
this is onpremise not possible.

History of Cloud Computing:
---------------------------
-- born in 2002
-- cloud computing born in 2002  born @ amozon.
-- 2006 amazon announced S3(Simple Storage Service)

eg: store the images of mobile in portal
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) like servers
In 2008 google came into the market by releasing google app engen
In 2009 microsoft released Azure
Oracle Cloud

-- Started with saling books


Why Cloud Computing? why companys are moving into cloud?

-- No upfront Investment.
-- Cloud computing abstracts powering,cooling,n/w, security and all maintaining IT resources.
-- Provides agility i.e speed.
-- We can get things within minutes.
-- Cloud provide a flexibility i.e at runtime on demand we can expand and shrink servers.
-- Cloud computing enables us to define infrastructure as a code.
-- Automation
-- its like Rent a car.

Start understanding AWS
-------------------------
 -- aws providing 3 type of services
    1)IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)
       we are getting IT infrastructurte via internet . some one has to monitor,        update the services. it is on our hand.
    2)PaaS (Platform as a service)
      eg: db server , oracle,mysql,tomcat server  these are maintained by theire       controller
      ELB
    3)SaaS (Software as a service)
  eg: web application. we maintain

-- 18% cost reduces.
-- servers in US is very cheap
-- buying Infrastructure in india expansive.

AWS Global Infrastructure
-------------------------
-- To avoid the latancy maintain Infrastructure.
-- Aws Infrastructure is present across the globe.
-- Regions i.e Geographical area. 10 -12 regions
-- Availability Zone : represents  a physical a data center.AZ
    In every region aws maintains two are more data centers/AZ

How to Get into Cloud?
