Identity and Access Management (IAM):
*************************************
services-->security,Identity&Co..
-- create user
-- specific resource

Using IAM we can create users and grant console access this account.

-- create user
-- attach permission to user
-- grant the access to console

Step 1:

Users-->Add user-->set user details-->select AWS access Type:
-- Programmatic access
-- Aws Mgmt console access

  Console password
  Auto pwd
  Custom password

Require password reset : check

Step 2:

  db admin // only db access give the rds permissions
  cloud admin // all access
  you get the one link access that.
  reset the password

Programmatic access:
--------------------
  App code
  Webserver      ---- app code to communicate --- DynamoDB
  Ec2 instance

Multifactor authontication :
----------------------------
After login ask the some code that code comes to mobile.


IAM(Identity Access Mgmt):

Programatic access
--------------------
-- you can access from console
-- you can access from code i.e programatic access
-- policy represents set of permissions
-- Roles are generally attached to EC2 instance


Add user:
---------
select aws access type:
--From java code to list buckets using sdk we can get progamatic access aws java jdk
-- to access s3 , bucket from java need accesskey secret access key.


MFA: Multifactor Auth
---------------------

-- it will add one more layer to make a secure. i.e barcode number auth.

eg:
2 acct 
user1 acct1
user2 acct 2
-- to provide access to get resource  acct1 for user2.
-- we can configure cross account access 

IAM - Group:
-------------
Group Name:
-----------
-- Attach Policy- nothing but permission
-- S3 - Simple Storage Service

Policy:
-------
-- kind of document tells what type permissions.
-- talks about permissions
-- Using JSON document
eg:
To access to Ec2 for the create set of permissions
To access to S3 for the create the set of permissions

JSON Document:
-- -------------------
-- its a Javascript object notation.
-- represent the data and exchange the data.
-- Nutral format
 
mango db: represents JSON
// document about data
{
   "empId" :2303109, // Number
    "name" :"Reddy" ,  // string
     "isManager":true, // boolean
     "mobile":["1234566","24234234"] ,  // array
//Object notation in {}
      ''address":{
      "HNO":"40",
      "city":"Banglore",
      "Country":"India"
     }

mutiple objects
''address":[{
      "HNO":"40",
      "city":"Banglore",
      "Country":"India"
     },
{
      "HNO":"40",
      "city":"Banglore",
      "Country":"India"
     }]

}

Roles:
-------
-- likes group only
-- Roles also act like groups
-- You attach polices to roles
-- Roles are mainly used for giving permission to aws resource 
   it can access aws resources

eg:
--Ec2 to talk to S3
--Role attach to instance

-- Ec2 wants a permission to talk to S3 buckets for this we create a role
   attach a policy which give access to S3 and add this role to EC2    Instances.

Note:
-- we can assign a role to EC2 instance only at the time of lanching it    after lanching Ec2 
-- there is no way to attach a role.

-- 2 act - 
the user in another account i want access of other access
cross - account access
--using a role we can enable cross-account access


Using IAM:
----------
-- we can federate with 3 party identity providers
-- active directory, google account,facebook

eg: have LDAP user in company and you have AWS account you want these LDAP users in aws account use federate 


Managing Pwd Policy:

MultiFactor Authontication:

RSA tokens SecureID:





IAM:
****
-- allow about securing aws resources.like ec2,s3,load balancer.
-- we can use IAM to provide console access to diff users.


delete your root access keys

How to login to console with diff user and we can give access to aws console

-- creat a user
-- goto add user
    user:devopstoolsteam
    passowd: devops123
-- it will ask to create group must add group give the    adminstrationaccess and send a email.
-- EC2 to access s3 if your in same account its completly retricted.
-- Ec2 places the files in s3.
