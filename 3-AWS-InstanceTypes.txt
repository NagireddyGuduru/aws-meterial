Instance :
t2.micro here 

t - bustable performance
    works based on cpu credits  if cpu is idle it gains cpu credit points.
    if our ec2 instance wants perform our baseline its spents cpu credit points and gains above baseline performance.

2 represents second generation
micro- size of instance.

Note: aws suggest to go with latest generations.



General Purpose:
t- family recomanded consisten performance eg:qa,uat,staging area- use general purpose
we want server to be active only in business hrs and remains inactive will get credit points.

m4- provide baseline consistant performance.

eg:dev,testing server..,jenkins
General Purpose recamanded for dev,testing environments , they also recomanded for small,media databases.

compute optimzation:
This family is optimized for compute intensive workloads which provides low case vCPU.
Recomanded for high traffic frontended webservers.
Ditributed Analatics batch processing(runs backend some actions)

when we need more compute power
eg:
online videos games
flipcart

GPU Instances:
Grphics Processing Unit
-- better Graphics performance and n/w performance.

memory optimized:
Is a lowcost for RAM recomanded for database applications,distbuted cache.
memcacheD
redis cachie
zemfile
ehcache.

Storage optimizations:(HDD)
base on I/O operations

Ec2 instance resize:
Note: To resize ec2-instance instance should not be running state.

Storage Types:
only for Ec2 instances.
Instance Store
EBS- Elastic block store

Instance Storage:
Its a temporary storage associated with Ec2 instance.
very cheap
put cache on webserver
ephemeral storage
data on instance store is lost if you stop ec2.
AMIS-->Root device type --> Instance store.

EBS:
provides persistance storage
we can dettache from one ec2 and attach to another ec2
EBS is AZ specific.
you can takes the backups ie.create the snapshot.
EBS is HA internally they maintain a replica i.e duplicate copy.
