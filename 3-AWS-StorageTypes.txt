Storage optimizations:(HDD)
base on I/O operations

Ec2 instance resize:
Note: To resize ec2-instance instance should not be running state.

Storage Types:
only for Ec2 instances.
Instance Store
EBS- Elastic block store

Instance Storage:
Its a temporary storage associated with Ec2 instance.
very cheap
put cache on webserver
ephemeral storage
data on instance store is lost if you stop ec2.
AMIS-->Root device type --> Instance store.

EBS:
provides persistance storage
we can dettache from one ec2 and attach to another ec2
EBS is AZ specific.
you can takes the backups ie.create the snapshot.
EBS is HA internally they maintain a replica i.e duplicate copy.

I have EBS in AZ and need data to be linked with in another AZ.?
Yes, With the help of Snapshot.
