How many ways can create EBS
*****************************
1) At time of lanching Ec2 instance
2) Ec2 d/b-create volume
3) we can create EBS from a snapshot

volume : drive
---------------
-- we can attach one volum for one Ec2 instance
-- snapshots stored in S3. we cannot see physically
-- EBS supports Data encryption

EBS - Volume Types
-------------------
1) General Purpose SSE -- its not for production usage
   Note:30 GB free
   -- Any General Purpose its not for production usage.
2) Provisioned IOPS SSD 
   -- ment for m/c critical operations
   -- RDMS,Mango DB
   -- Mainly for database application 
   -- IO  operations
3) Throughout optimized HDD
   -- IO operations + size of data
   -- Bigdata,Hadoop
   -- amont of data . size of input and size of output.
   -- reading is 1GB
   -- frequently accessed data
4) Cool HDD
   -- Infrequently access data go for Cool HDD.
   -- cheap storage
   -- 65,000 i.e 65000 hits in this case we need 3 valumes
   -- above 65000 go for RAID
