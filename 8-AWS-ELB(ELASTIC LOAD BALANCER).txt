DNS:(Domain Naming System)
**************************
-- Its a peace of software which a mapping b/w a domain name and ip address

Load Blancing:
**************
-- It is a Server i.e web server. it distributes the load across multiple backend servers.
-- based on algorithem do load balancing.Round Robine algorithems
-- root to least busy server
-- map DNS to Load balancer internally and LB will decide which least busy server.
Term:
super busy.

Load balancers
 .apache
 .NGINS

ELB[Elastic Load Balancer]:
**************************
-- Plotform as service
-- It is higly available(HA) i.e scalability nothing but performance
-- It is highly performable

Supports:
       1)Internal LB
       2)External LB
-- We can do internale as well as external balancing
-- Internal - within the network -- intranet
-- External - internet facing n/w -- exposed to the internet.
-- ELB perform Health Check Operations on the backend services.
-- If backend server not healthy ELB takes out of service.
-- Health Checks mean server is down , server not responding in time.    response should get in 2 seconds.
-- ELB can be integrated with Auto Scalling.
-- can do SSL(Encript,Decript) termination
   Browser send Encrypted Data and the process of decripting the data is    called SSL termination.
-- When we user https client send the req with encryption responsible to    decrypt request
   nothing but termination of SSL
-- ELB region specific.
-- It can be integrated with auto scalling i.e based on the load add    instance.
   your infrastrucre can grow.
   scal up, scal down. 

horizontal scalling - adding server
vertical scalling - incresing ram,cpu,n/w perfomance.
eg: increase 5 cpu, 8 GB
-- we can enable cloud watch i.e a monitoring tools with diff metrics of ELB




min 1
max 5 
some time low 
you dont want to terminate instance perticaular instance go for this option.

While configuring Auto Scalling to set min max instances?
YES.
can we set min max 
SSL(secure TCP)
 

ELB(Elastic Load Balancer):

-- can load balance the Ec2 instance in the same region.

interval:
   every 10 sec it will check the status
Unhealthy threshold: 
   5 concequitve requests

Service-->Resource Group-->ELB-Elastic Load Balancer
Health Check

-- should get response in 2 sec
-- check the health of every 30 min
-- threshold - 3 time check in every 30 min
-- threshold nothing but how many  times has to check

if not get the response may be reasons
server down
reponse not quickly


Task:
creating ec2 instance install webserver to deploying 

-- create the ec2 instance virtual m/c 
ssh
ssh -i ~/D/*.pem ec2-user@instance id
sudo yum install httpd
cd /var/www/html/  // if you want to host your website place here i.e document root
sudo service 

-- on top of it we need  web server 
-- in web server we need  multiple instance
--  add to load balancers
-- DNS name is loadbalancer name
-- it will do health check every 15 sec
-- stop on instance and check the response.
-- Route53


what is connection Drainig period?

if ec2 instance is unhealthy befor taking out of service ELB gives certain time
to ec2 ot complete current processing request.

eg: you server busy its not yet given the reponse of  request it will give the certain time.


Stickyness:
************
Authenticating the process
eg:
webserver1,webserver2,webserver3
migrate in all server
1) approach
   enable stickyness
eg:  in webserver1 on client1 seconde request has to this server only. 
client 1:
first request process by webserver1 then second request should process by webserver1 only. for this we need enable stickyness.

webserver1 -- client 1
webserver2-- client 2
webserver 3-- client 3

if we enable sticky session all requests coming from a perticular client is processed by only one server.

2) approach:
In side server,
Use
DynamoDB- no sequal database server, we will store session data.joins will not support
eg: add to cart. in cart portals.
use of cache perpose. amozon resource
DynamoDB-- Amazon resource.
CacheoDB

Elasitc Beanstalk- tomcat.

application load balacncer -- multiple ports,  classic load balancers- supports single port.
