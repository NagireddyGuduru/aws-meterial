IAM:

We should not use root users for day to day activity we have to create admin user and use it
instead of root user


IAM:

Create admin user account and use it.

eg:
	username:dbadmin
	access type:  
	
	 Programmatic accesss - programmes can do operation on aws resouces
		eg: python application upload to s3 and you want cli
		cli - helps to integrate with tools like jenkins
	 
	 aws mgmt console access

Note:(allways better to give both)

	console password: auto generated pwd

	set permisssion - Attach existing polices directly 


Task:create user and attach adminaccess existing polices.

Task:  Customize login url for user

Task : create a group with ecefullaccess and add users in that group

steps: create New group-group name- ec2full access and add users in that group

Task: reset the password
- users-security credentials - manage password - require password reset select

Task: enabling MFA

 - root user - activate MFA for root user
 - devices - virtual device and h/w device(rsa token generate device)
 select - virtual device
 manage MFA device - scan device

 enable MFS for root user
 enable MFA for IAM users

Note: you cannot operate two user in same browser

Policies:

- It json formate containing set of permissions. we can attach a police to the user,group and role.

-create policy:
	policy have version and statement
	In statement have action,resources
		action - launch instance, stop instance, create IAS user
		Resources - all resources ie. ec2, RDS,
					any ec2 instance
					any RDS instance

	ec2 - is service
	ec2 instance is resource


Task : create custom policy

- eg: i want policy which allows iam user to start, stop and list ec2 instances.

step 1:

create a policy

visual editor:

service - ec2
actions - if you want all select all ec2 instance or search in search box - with start, describeinstances(list the ec2instance),stopinstances

Resources: all resources - anyone can instance and start and stop.

Review Policy:

Assign to some user
Test:
Select user- filter polices- select the policy-add permission
